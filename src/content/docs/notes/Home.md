It's like, I'm totally open to guidance, but I'm also constantly looking for ways to step up and make things happen."
* I like it when people have a vision and I can make it happen
* I thrive on turning someone else's vision into reality.
* "I really enjoy working with people who have a clear vision because I find it fulfilling to bring that vision to life. It's rewarding to be able to take their ideas and turn them into something tangible and impactful."
