I'm at a crossroads in my life right now. I resigned from my professional career with the federal government in 2019 after 15 years) to stay home with my kids who were 7 and 2 (twins)  at the time. Now, that the kids are older and entering school full time, I'm itching to get back in the working world, especially because we live with my mother in law who is a nightmare and I want our own place again. 
I've been looking for jobs that are flexible, so not really looking to do what I did before. I have a background in IT so shouldn't be hard... except it is! It's very hard to find a job that's flexible and allows me to be around for the kids.  Am I expecting too much? Is it wrong of me to want to be available for the kids in a day and age where I do believe kids need to know that at least one parent is available to them? Do women just not have the luxury of doing what they love and being around for the kids? I works live the idea of getting our kids the house while the kids are in school, but I also want flexibility to drop them off and pick them up from school. I have the option of taking a job that would basically pay for my kids to go to private hs, but it would require me to be away from them all day until 5pm. I can't really stomach that!  What should I do?
